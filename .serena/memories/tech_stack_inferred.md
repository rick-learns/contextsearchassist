# Inferred Technology Stack

Based on the project structure, the following technology stack is inferred:

## Backend
The project appears to have a structured backend with handlers, middleware, models, and utilities, suggesting a server-side component. Without specific files, the exact technology cannot be determined, but common options could include:

- Python (possibly with Flask, Django, or FastAPI)
- Node.js (Express.js or similar framework)

## Frontend
The frontend structure with components organized into common, extension, and website categories suggests:

- Modern JavaScript/TypeScript framework (likely React, Vue, or Angular)
- Browser extension development capabilities
- Component-based architecture

## Project Name and Purpose
The project name "ContextSearchAssist" and the component structure (especially the "extension" directory) suggests this is likely a browser extension that enhances search capabilities with additional context.

**Note**: This is based on directory structure inference only. Additional information from actual code files or documentation would be needed for more precise details.
