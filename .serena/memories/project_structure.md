# Project Structure Overview

The project appears to be set up with a standard frontend/backend structure but without actual code files yet.

## Top-Level Directories:
- `attached_assets/`: Currently empty, likely for storing project assets.
- `backend/`: Backend code structure with subdirectories for different components.
- `frontend/`: Frontend code structure with public and src directories.

## Backend Structure:
- `backend/handlers/`: Likely for handling API requests and routes.
- `backend/middleware/`: For middleware components.
- `backend/models/`: For data models and schema definitions.
- `backend/utils/`: For utility functions and helper modules.

## Frontend Structure:
- `frontend/public/`: For static assets.
- `frontend/src/`: Source code for the frontend.
  - `frontend/src/components/`: UI components organized into subdirectories:
    - `common/`: Reusable components.
    - `extension/`: Components specific to browser extension functionality.
    - `website/`: Components for the website interface.
  - `frontend/src/styles/`: Styling files.

The project directory structure suggests a web application with both browser extension and website components, likely focused on context search assistance.
