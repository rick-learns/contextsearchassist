# Task Completion Guidelines

Since the project appears to be in its early stages with primarily directory structure set up, here are general guidelines for completing tasks:

## Code Contribution Process

1. **Before Starting a Task**:
   - Ensure you understand the requirements
   - Pull the latest changes from the main branch
   - Create a new branch for your feature/fix

2. **During Development**:
   - Follow the established directory structure
   - Add code to appropriate locations (frontend/backend)
   - If creating new components or modules, follow the existing organization patterns
   - Write clean, documented code
   - Include appropriate error handling

3. **Before Committing**:
   - Ensure code is properly formatted (using the project's formatter)
   - Run linters to check for code quality issues
   - Run tests to ensure functionality works as expected
   - Review your changes

4. **When Task is Complete**:
   - Commit your changes with a descriptive message
   - Push your branch to the remote repository
   - Create a pull request for review
   - Address any feedback from code reviews

## Testing Guidelines

- Write tests for new functionality
- Ensure all existing tests pass
- Consider edge cases and error scenarios

## Documentation

- Update documentation to reflect your changes
- Document any new APIs, components, or significant functionality
- Include comments for complex logic

**Note**: These are general guidelines based on best practices. Once the project has more code and specific configuration files, these guidelines should be updated to match the project's specific requirements and conventions.
